Welcome to the Media Data Analysis project! This repository contains code and resources for analyzing media data using machine learning techniques. The project aims to extract valuable insights and patterns from media datasets to support various applications such as content recommendation, sentiment analysis, and trend prediction.

## Overview

In today's digital age, vast amounts of media data are generated daily, ranging from text articles and social media posts to images and videos. Analyzing and understanding this data can provide valuable insights into user preferences, trends, and sentiments. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to process and analyze media data, enabling the extraction of meaningful information for decision-making and optimization.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess media data to remove noise and prepare it for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from different types of media data, including text, images, and videos.
- **Content Recommendation**: Build recommendation systems based on user preferences and content similarity.
- **Trend Prediction**: Predict trends and identify emerging topics or themes within media datasets.
- **Classification using Deep Learning** Predict the recall of advertisements using a deep neural network model.
